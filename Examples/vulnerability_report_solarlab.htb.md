| Open HTTP Port with Outdated Nginx Version | Medium: An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in the outdated Nginx version to gain unauthorized access or cause a Denial of Service (DoS).                                                                               | High: Given the popularity of Nginx and the availability of exploits for older versions, the likelihood of exploitation is high.                  | Update Nginx to the latest stable version and regularly apply patches and updates.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Open MSRPC Port                            | High: An attacker could potentially use this to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS).                                                                                                                          | Medium: Exploitation of this service requires specific knowledge and tools, but given its exposure, the likelihood is medium.                     | Block this port in the firewall or disable this service if it is not needed.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Open NetBIOS Port                          | High: An attacker could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to system files and sensitive data.                                                                                                                                | Medium: Exploitation of this service requires specific knowledge and tools, but given its exposure, the likelihood is medium.                     | Block this port in the firewall or disable this service if it is not needed.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Open Microsoft-DS Port                     | High: An attacker could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to system files and sensitive data.                                                                                                                                | Medium: Exploitation of this service requires specific knowledge and tools, but given its exposure, the likelihood is medium.                     | Block this port in the firewall or disable this service if it is not needed.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Missing X-Frame-Options Header             | Medium: The absence of the X-Frame-Options header allows the site to be framed by an attacker, leading to potential clickjacking attacks.                                                                                           | Medium: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability if they can trick a user into clicking on a malicious link.                                    | Implement the X-Frame-Options header in the site's HTTP response.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header      | Medium: Without the X-Content-Type-Options header, the user agent might interpret the site's content differently from its MIME type, leading to potential security risks.                                                           | Medium: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability if they can manipulate the site's content type.                                                | Set the X-Content-Type-Options header in the site's HTTP response to 'nosniff'.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Exposed wp-config.php File                 | High: The wp-config.php file contains sensitive information like database credentials. If exposed, it can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.                                                                  | High: The wp-config.php file is directly accessible, making it highly likely for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.                       | Restrict access to the wp-config.php file and ensure it is not directly accessible over the internet.                                                                                                                               |
| Outdated Nginx Version                     | High: Using an outdated version of Nginx could expose the server to known vulnerabilities that have been fixed in later versions. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services.         | High: Given that the version of Nginx is outdated, it is highly likely that an attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities.                      | Update Nginx to the latest stable version.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Outdated JQuery Version                    | Medium: Using an outdated version of JQuery could expose the application to known vulnerabilities that have been fixed in later versions. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts or disrupt services. | Medium: Given that the version of JQuery is outdated, it is moderately likely that an attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities.               | Update JQuery to the latest stable version.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Outdated Modernizr Version                 | Low: Using an outdated version of Modernizr could expose the application to known vulnerabilities that have been fixed in later versions. This could potentially allow an attacker to disrupt services.                             | Low: Given that the version of Modernizr is outdated, it is less likely that an attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities.                     | Update Modernizr to the latest stable version.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Unprotected Directories                    | Medium: Unprotected directories can expose sensitive information to unauthorized users, potentially leading to data leakage or unauthorized modification of data.                                                                   | High: The likelihood of exploitation is high as the directories are publicly accessible and can be easily discovered by automated scanning tools. | Implement access controls and authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive directories. Regularly review and update permissions to ensure only authorized users have access.                                                      |
| Server Error Status Codes                  | Low: Server error status codes (500) can indicate server misconfigurations or unstable server conditions, potentially leading to service disruption or providing an entry point for further attacks.                                | Medium: The likelihood of exploitation is medium as it requires specific knowledge and skills to exploit server errors.                           | Investigate the cause of the server errors and fix any server misconfigurations or unstable conditions. Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to prevent exposure of sensitive information through error messages. |
